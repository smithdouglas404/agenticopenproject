   * Preserves scroll position during DOM manipulations that change content height.
   *
   * This is crucial for infinite scroll UX - when older content is prepended above
   * the current view, we need to adjust scroll position so the user doesn't suddenly
   * jump to a different part of the content.
   *
   * @param {HTMLElement} container - The scrollable container
   * @param {boolean} isPrepending - Whether content is being added at the top (prepend)
   *                                  true: adjust scroll for prepended content
   *                                  false: maintain position for appended content
   * @param {Function} renderFn - Async function that performs the DOM manipulation
   *
   * Algorithm:
   * - Capture current scroll position and total height BEFORE DOM changes
   * - Execute the DOM manipulation (adding/removing content)
   * - Calculate height difference and adjust scroll position accordingly
   *
   * For prepend: scrollTop + heightDifference (push view down by added content height)
   * For append: maintain original scrollTop (new content below doesn't affect view)

   * Temporarily pauses inertial/momentum scrolling to prevent scroll position drift.
   *
   * CRITICAL for iOS Safari and other mobile browsers with momentum scrolling!
   *
   * The Problem:
   * When programmatically setting scrollTop during an active momentum scroll,
   * the browser continues the inertial scroll AFTER our position adjustment,
   * causing the scroll position to drift away from our intended target.
   *
   * The Solution:
   * - Set overflow: hidden to immediately stop any momentum scrolling
   * - Use requestAnimationFrame to restore overflow on next frame
   * - This gives us a clean slate to set the exact scroll position
   *
   * Without this, scroll preservation would be unreliable on mobile devices,
   * especially during infinite scroll when users are actively scrolling up.

   * @param {Element} container - The scrollable container to pause momentum on
