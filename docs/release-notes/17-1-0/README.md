## Important feature changes

### Automated project initiation request with a guided wizard (Enterprise add-on)

OpenProject introduces a configurable wizard for project initiation requests. The wizard is available as an **Enterprise add-on in the Premium plan** and can be enabled per project template.

#### Configurable project initiation wizard

Administrators can configure a project initiation wizard to define how new project requests are submitted. This includes selecting which project attributes and sections are shown in the wizard, and which fields are required or optional.

The wizard guides users step by step through the initiation process using a fullscreen, three-column layout with section navigation, contextual help, and a progress indicator. Instead of completing required project attributes during project creation, users provide this information as part of the initiation request.

#### Create a project initiation request as a work package

When a project initiation request is submitted, OpenProject automatically creates a work package that represents the request and serves as its central tracking artifact.

The work package is created based on the wizard configuration, including work package type, status, and assignee. Assignment can be derived from a project attribute or a project role, such as a project owner. The work package contains links back to the wizard and can be processed using existing workflows.

#### Automatically generated project initiation artifact (PDF)

Upon submission of the project initiation request, a PDF artifact is automatically generated. The artifact contains all information entered in the wizard and is attached to the corresponding work package for documentation and audit purposes.

The artifact is updated automatically whenever the status of the project initiation request work package changes, ensuring that the documentation always reflects the current state.

#### Changed enforcement of required project attributes when using templates

When projects are created from templates with an enabled initiation wizard, required project attributes are no longer enforced during project creation. Instead, they are collected as part of the initiation request workflow. For projects created without templates, required attributes continue to be enforced during project creation.

>[!NOTE]
> The project initiation request workflow is particularly well suited for structured frameworks such as PM² or PMflex, while remaining flexible enough to be used independently of any specific methodology. Read this blog article for more information: https://www.openproject.org/blog/project-initiation-workflow-pm2/

### Updates for the Meetings module

The Meetings module received several improvements that extend how meeting results are documented, reused, and shared.

#### Add new or existing work packages as meeting outcomes

Users can now add work packages as meeting outcomes, allowing teams to turn meeting results into actionable follow-up items without leaving the meeting context. They can either:

- link an existing work package, or
- create a new work package as an outcome.

Each linked work package automatically shows a reference to the meeting in its Meetings tab, making the connection between the agenda item and the follow-up item explicit.

Since OpenProject 17.0 allows multiple outcomes per agenda item, it is now also possible to link multiple work packages to the same agenda item.

#### Show meeting participant responses in iCal subscriptions

Meeting participant responses are now handled more consistently across OpenProject and external calendars. Responses such as accepted, declined, or no response are visible directly in the meeting, making it easier to see the current participation status of all attendees.

In addition, participant responses are now included in iCal subscriptions. This allows calendar applications to display the response status of meeting participants and keep it in sync with the information shown in OpenProject.

#### Duplicate agenda items to the next recurring meeting occurrence

Users can now duplicate agenda items to the next occurrence of a recurring meeting. This makes it possible to carry over open topics or recurring discussion points without recreating them manually.

To duplicate an agenda item, users can select the corresponding option from the agenda item actions menu. The duplicated agenda item is added to the next meeting occurrence and can be edited independently.
