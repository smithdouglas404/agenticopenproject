module Versions
  # Releases a version of kind "release": handles its incomplete (open) work packages
  # according to the chosen strategy, then marks the release as closed (= released).
  #
  # Incomplete work packages are those linked to the release through its Release custom
  # field whose status is not closed. Strategies:
  #   * "roll_forward" - move them to another open release (+target_version+)
  #   * "decouple"     - clear the release link, returning them to the backlog
  #   * "force"        - leave them linked to the now-closed release
